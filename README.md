# Dashboard Project

This project is a dashboard layout built using **HTML** and **CSS Grid**. It was created as part of The Odin Project to practice structuring and styling web pages using **CSS Grid**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to replicate a given design as closely as possible while focusing on proper **grid layout techniques**. The dashboard consists of:

- A **sidebar** for navigation and branding.
- A **header** that includes a search bar, user information, and buttons.
- A **main content area** displaying projects, announcements, and trending items.

ðŸš€ **Note:** This project is **not responsive or interactive**, as the focus was primarily on layout structure rather than responsiveness.
